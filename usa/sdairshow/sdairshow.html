<p align="center">There is a Marine Corps air station in the Miramar area near San Diego. Every year there is a major military and civilian air show there. In Oct. 2002 we went to see this impressive air show in Miramar. Here are some pictures from this event.

<p align="CENTER"><IMG src="airshow1.jpg" width="400" height="300"> <BR><FONTsize=2>Ali, Saman and Saba with America's latest killing machine, the remote controlled Predator. In the back a F15. 

<p align="CENTER"><IMG src="airshow2.jpg" width="400" height="300"> <BR>There were non-flying 
hardware on display too. Here I am talking with a Marine sniper aboout his 
rifle, while Saba is minding her image. The bolt action rifle, according to the 
sniper, is a Remington 7.62 with a Leupold scope. 

<p align="CENTER"><IMG src="airshow3.jpg" width="542" height="359"> <BR>The show was not limited 
to military hardware and skills. Some very good civil aerobatics were performed, 
including this one by the Oracle aerobatics team. 

<p align="CENTER"><IMG src="airshow4.jpg" width="628" height="240"> <BR>The most interesting 
demo, however, was not done by an airplane, but a 'truck'. This is a truck with 
three jet engines which did 300 mph on the ground.
