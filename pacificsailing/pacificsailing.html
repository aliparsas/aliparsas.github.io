We showed up on the deck in our best dresses. Don recited a poem he wrote about our trip. I and Ben were first time crossers, so after an oration praising Neptune, the Sea god by Brian, we had to drink a suspisious liquid and then we became 'Shellbacks'. Some of us wore the t-shirts Don gave us as a souvenir of this trip. Then we posed for this picture.<p>Here is Don's poem:<p>Nyami- Nyami,<br>Guided by the goddess of the sea<br>By name of Neptune-be she-<br>On board, we have Brian, Kat, Ali, Ben and me<P>We left La Paz, adios amigo-friends and all<br>Brian and Kat finishing a game of, vollyball<p>Ben-with a little help from his mate<br>Got Nyami-Nyami in ship shape<br>He worked on winches-greasing and stripping<br>Climbed the mast-inspected the sails and rigging<br>Descended to be rewarded with my thanks and good cheer<br>To which he responded “fuck that - give me a beer!!”<p>So all is set-anchors up and the lines are cut<br>Goodbyes to "Puddy Cat"-- Frans, Rio, Harry and Gary, Kieth and Olina<br>Nev and Maggie, Pixys, Kupuka and "Hote Mai"<br>Sad as it is, but it’s our gain, or is it our loss?<br>The sky is brightened with fireworks from "Betsy Ross"<br>Now for certain, Nyami-Nyami - is part of us<br>As we sail and head for… Los  Meurtos <p>In Cabo San Lucas we repair and re-fuel,<br>Re-provision-- clean the bottom<br>Perchance, is there anything we have forgotten?<br>All aboard now photos on deck-- what the heck, all round smiles<br>For the Southern hemisphere is miles and miles<p>Becalmed, 3 days out on the Pacific blue--no wind -its hot- shall we swim or not?<br>First in is Ali- ...

<td>I broke my arm while jumping in a calm sea three days into the trip. I endured the pain all through it till we reached Hiva Oa. There I had to cut short my trip and take a plane to Papeete (Tahiti) and from there to San Francisco. The fracture is visible in this MRI image which was taken after a month, when I was back in San Francisco.</td>
