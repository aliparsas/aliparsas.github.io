WWII movie buffs know that in such movies while the American guy uses a
slick machine gun, the unlucky German soldiers carry a long, clumsy
rifle, and usually are either killed before being able to use it or
their shots just happen not to hit our hero.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="eaglesdare.jpg"><br><i>Hollywood's image of the rifle</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
gun used by the Wehrmacht was Mauser Kar98k, better known to its many
Iranian lovers as Brno. Clumsy? No way. Even after more than a hundred
years since its invention it is still sought after by hunters and rifle
collectors for its accuracy and reliability. The rough estimates of the
number of Mausers manufactured for military use since the last days of
the 19th century vary widely, but a conservative estimate is 100
million rifles. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="kar98k.jpg"><br><i>Kar98k</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
rifle was invented in Germany by the Mauser brothers. Peter Paul Mauser
was born in Oberndorff, Germany in 1838. He and his older brother,
Wilhelm, became gun makers, and designed primarily military weapons for
the German government. Their finest design, the 1898 Mauser was adopted
by the German army and have since been regarded as the best bolt-action
design ever. Their ideas can be seen in many sporting (hunting) rifles
even today. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="mauserbros.jpg"><br><i>The Mauser Brothers</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
Mauser 1898, with an overall length of 1250 mm, was issued under the
name G98 (for Gewehr 98, meaning rifle model 1898) for the German army.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="g98.jpg"><br><i>Mauser G98</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Soon
other countries, anticipating the Great War in a time that was called
'Armed Peace', adopted this well designed bolt-action rifle for their
armies. Different Mauser rifles and clones have been made in virtually
every industrialized country in the world, either via licensing
agreements with the Mauser factory in Orberndorf, Germany or licencing
from copy makers in Czechoslovakia and even simple piracy of the
design. Good-quality clones of the '98 have been made in, or
manufactured for, Spain, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Peru, Persia, Belgium,
Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Yugoslavia, and Venezuela. Even some
models of the American Springfield and the British Lee-Enfield used
this design.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">At almost the
same time that Mauser firearms were introduced, they found their way
into Iran. Looking at pictures of Iran's Constitutional Revolution era,
one can spot Mauser rifles and handguns in the hands of freedom
fighters of Sattar khan and Bagher khan, as well as other
Constitutionalists in different regions of Iran.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="constitutionalists.jpg"><br><i>Iranain Constitutionalists, with their Mausers, in 1906</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">At
the end of World War I, and as a result of the Versailles treaty arms
ban, Germany no longer produced these rifles, but an almost exact copy
was in production in Czechoslovakia. After Hitler became the German
chancellor, the production was resumed in Germany.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="hitler.jpg"><br><i>Hitler resumed production of Mausers in Germany</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Later, with the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the identical rifle was produced in Germany and Czechoslovakia.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="czechdrill.jpg"><br><i>Czechoslovak Army Drill, 1938</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">A major production center was in Brünn, or <a href="http://www.brno-city.cz/main/index-en.htm">Brno</a>,
as the city is called in the Czech language. The rifles made in Brno,
the Czechoslovakian model, are known as VZ24 (for Vzor24, or model24 in
Czech language) and had the word Brno imprinted on them.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="vz24.jpg"><br><i>Czechoslovakian VZ24</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="czechmarkings.jpg"><br><i>Markings of a VZ24</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Officially,
the Mauser rifle was selected for the Iranian army during Reza shah's
time. But Iran didn't go for the original German and ordered the
identical Czechoslovakian version, the so-called Brno. The Czech firm
provided Iran rifles made of many German parts. It was similar to the
long version German known as G98. Some official test results are
available from antique arms dealers today, featuring signatures of the
Brno factory representative, the Iranian in charge, and of course,
satisfactory 'grouping' or bullet marks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="testresult.jpg"><br><i>A 1934 test result document</i> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="boland.jpg"><br><i> Full length 'Brno' with markings in Persian</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">At
that time two other rifles were in use and very well known in Iran: the
British Lee-Enfield and the Russian Mosin-Nagant (Noghaan, or Naaghaan,
(نوغان- ناغان) in popular parlance in those days). The exact reason for
preferring Brno over its rivals is not known, but one can speculate
that those in charge of the Iranian army, or maybe Reza shah himself,
tried to avoid dependence of Iran to either of the two neighboring
powers. Besides, Brno was considered to be the best military rifle of
its day. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The Iranian
government ordered three sizes of this weapon. It was manufactured in
Czechoslovakia by two firms. One was called Ceskoslovenska Zbrojovka,
or CZ. These rifles are known to collectors as Persian CZ98, Persian
Mauser or Persian Brno. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">A
Pahlavi crown, lion and sun crest appears near the feeding ring, as an
inscription in Persian (in Nasta'liq script) on the side of its
magazine giving the model and the factory name, which was in Brno. From
then on the name Brno was used by Iranians to refer to this rifle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="crest.jpg"><br><i>Lion and Sun crest of a Persian Mauser</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="persianmarkings.jpg"><br><i>Persian markings of a Brno made rifle</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">One
typical such inscription read "tofang-e nemoone 1309 karkhane-ye aslahe
sazi berno" ("Rifle model 1309 Made at Brno Arms factory." The number
1309 refers to the Persian year 1309which is the year 1930 in the
Western calendar).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">In the
late 1940s Iran's Taslihat-e Artesh (Arms Factories of the Army),
popularly known as Mosalsal-sazi (the machine-gun factory), in Tehran
started production of these Brno rifles. The needed machinery and know
how was provided to Iran through the industrial firm Škoda, which had a
long history of cooperation with Iran. Iran produced two models: the
regular VZ24 rifle (similar to the German Kar98k, overall length 1110
mm) and the short version (similar to the German G30, overall length
993 mm) known as "Berno kootah" (short Brno).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="kootah.jpg"><br><i>Berno Kootah (short Brno)</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">under
a licence from CZ. Th The difference was only in the markings on the
side of magazine: instead of naming Brno as the maker, it was written
"sakht-e aslah-e sazi-e artesh" (made by the Army arms factory). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="kootahmarkings.jpg"><br><i>Markings on an Iran made short Brno</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
products are known among the collectors as Persian Mauser and are
regarded to be the best and smoothest of the Mauser family of
bolt-action rifles.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">For many
years Brno was the standard personal weapon of the Iranian armed
forces, until it was replaced by the more modern, semi-automatic,
American Garand M1, and later by the German Heckler &amp; Koch G3.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
rifle was especially chrished by Iranian tribes, who are known to be
gun lovers and able shooters. A tribesman sharpshooter would settle for
nothing less than a Brno. Tribal rebels did everything to acquire one
of these rifles, and they did get their hands on these in many tribal
wars during Reza shah and Mohammad Reza shah's time. And probably the
tribal chieftains, or khans, did get shipments from foreign sources, to
be distributed among their savars (mounted fighters). One single event,
which contributed to the widespread availability of Brno rifles among
the tribes in Iran, was the fall of Reza shah following the invasion of
Iran by the Allied forces in 1941. At that time the Iranian army, after
a short resistance, was almost disbanded and many people, especially
tribesmen, got hold of the Brnos left after the soldiers abandoned the
barracks. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">There are many
stories of the gun's accuracy among the tribes. When Dadshah rebelled
against the shah's government in Baluchistan in the 1950s, people said
that his wife, Bibi Khatoon, who accompanied him in the mountains, at
one occasion, took her Brno and shot a bullet right into the barrel of
the gun of a poor gendarme who was aiming at her at a long distance.
Its popularity among Iranian tribes was so much that it was mentioned
in some of their songs. A version of a well-known Boyer Ahmad song has
a refrain that says "Mastom, Mastom, Brno kootah be dastom" (I'm drunk
and have a short Brno in my hand).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">For
the politically minded intellectuals of 1950s nad 1960s, the rifle was
a symbol of the shah's repressive rule. It can be seen in the pictures
of soldiers attacking house of Dr. Mossageq on the fateful day of 19
August 1953 (the infamous day of the US-British coup d'etas).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="mossadiqhouse.jpg"><br><i>Soldiers attacking the house of Dr. Mossadiq, Aug. 1953</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Gory
pictures of executions of Tudeh party officers in Chitgar shooting
range in 1955 shows defiant young officers strapped to the stake
minutes before execution, with Brnos present to do the task. When
Navab-Safavi, the fundamentalist leader of Fadaiian Islam was arrested,
Iranians saw his pictures being transferred to prison under bayoneted
Brnos. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="yazdi.jpg"><br><i>Dr. Yazdi, the Tudeh party leader, after arrest in 1953, surrounded by soldiers with Brnos</i> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="navab.jpg"><br><i>Navab-Safavi, the Fadaiian-e Islam leader arrested</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">You
can see it in pictures of 15 Khordad (June 1963) uprizing in Tehran. In
fact, when the shah's opposition cried against his "rule of the
bayonet", it was the sight of these Brnos with their bayonets attached
that they were referring to. </font></p>

<i>Soldiers with bayoneted Brnos during the Martial Law of 1963</i><br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Ordinary people usually had their
first encounter with the rifle while passing a guard in the street, or
when they were (willingly or otherwise) recruited for the military
service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="conscription.jpg"><br><i>A deserter is taken to military service in a Gilan village, circa 1955</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">In
the 1960s the semi-automatic US made M1 replaced Brno in the Iranian
army, and Brno use was confined to the gendarmerie and the game wardens
for a while, before it was decommissioned from active use. In the 1970s
it was used mainly in ceremonial occasions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="ceremony.jpg"><br><i>Girl cadets of the police academy in graduation ceremony, circa 1972</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Brno
was especially favorite among the Iranian tribes. Some of them even
named their daughters after the rifle. During the 1979 revolution, the
gun re-appeared in the hands of the revolutionaries and tribesmen, who
never abandoned their Brnos. When Kurds challenged the newly
established Islamic government, they used mostly modern assault rifles.
But Brno still had a use: The kurds claimed that with special
cartridges that can pierce 2cm of steel, Brno can down aircraft and
helicopters.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="kurds.jpg"><br><i>Kurdish 'Peshmarga's with Brno</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Besides
the rebels, the Islamic government too had a use for Brno: It was, and
is, used in official Friday prayer ceremonies. The speaker is required
to have 'the weapon of the day' by his side, according to the tradition
of the Prophet (he apparently used a sword).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="fridayprayer.jpg"><br><i>A friday prayer session, with Brno</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
most likely reason for its use in such ceremonies is that it is long
enough for the speaker to hold it like a walking stick while he is
standing and preaching. The Mauser brothers would have been happy to
hear that their rifle would be considered a 'weapon of the day' a
century later.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">For people of
my generation Persian Mauser, or Brno, brings back many bittersweet
memories. The coup, the executions, the NoghlAli (Iranian version of GI
Joe) with his Brno in a watch-cabin, the pain of being hit by its butt
in street demonstrations, the greedy gendarme guy looking for a chicken
to steal, the poor poacher in a remote town using the old rifle to feed
his family with meat once in a while. You see it in the old newspaper
pictures of battles, ceremonies, riots and executions. It is a piece of
history.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">----------------------------------------------</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Some Links:</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">A note on <a href="http://www.aliparsa.com/brno/sportized.html">Sportized Mauser</a></font></p><center><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><a href="http://www.aliparsa.com/index.html"><img alt="back to home" src="http://www.aliparsa.com/back.jpg" border="0"></a> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="http://www.aliparsa.com/email.gif" height="29" width="187"> </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="arial"><font color="#666666"><font size="1">Copyright � Ali Parsa 1998-2020<br>All rights reserved</font></font></font> </font></p></center>
