<br>Sportized Persian Mauser</font>
<P >This note was kindly sent to me by Mr. Shahrokh Alebooyeh:
<p> I was only 14 years old when I shot 
an Ibex (KAL [Boz E Koohi]) with an army Brno which my uncle who was a 
colonel in the Gendarmerie has lent to me. I dare say that the bolt and 
action is practically the most rugged ever built. Even today with the 
most advanced hunting and sniper rifles the M98 bolt & action is copied 
with minor modifications to the safety system being moved to the right 
side of the action so that a scope can be easily installed. With the 
original safety on top of the original bolt (once a scope is mounted) the 
safety knob can not make the full turn to the right, although the rifle 
will be safe if the safety knob is even half turned and this is what 
most hunters who have sporterised the Brno and mounted a scope, do. It is 
worth to note that a company by the name of "Buhler" has developed a 
safety knob which is somewhat smaller, especially for the Brno bolt and 
action. In so far as sporterising the Brno for hunting purposes is 
concerned, there is one other draw back and that is with its original 
"two-stage" pull on the trigger. This makes it quite difficult to hit the 
bull's eye (target) during hunting because more pressure needs to be 
exerted on the trigger, as well as passing the first stage on the pull to 
reach the second stage, as the shot is squeezed off. To over come this 
difficulty two companies by the names of Jaeger & Canjar manufacture 
trigger assemblies that are not only adjustable to the hunter's 
requirement, they also overcome the two-pull concept.

In the vent that you are not aware, presently the army is selling some 
of its Brno's to hunters at a price of 1.5 to 2 million Tomans, 
depending on the condition of the rifle. The stock is thrown away, the barrels 
re-blued as and as a new stock which is made by local expert craftsmen, 
fitted. Once the Buhler safeties and the new triggers are fitted, one 
hunter has one of the best hunting weapons. It should be added that due 
to the heavy weight of the bullet (180 to 220 Grains) the rifle falls 
short behind the much loved 270 Cal. or the famous 30-06 Cal. of the M1 
Garand. The 8X57MM  bullet of the Brno, does not enjoy the flat 
trajectory of the 270 or 30-06 calibres, or the modern magnums. However many 
big games continue to fall at long distances from the bullet of the 
famous Brno. The company Interarms Inc. in USA imports a bolt & action 
under the name of Interarms Mark X, which is a very near copy of the Brno 
bolt & action with better trigger and a safety located on the right side 
of the action. Many new hunting rifles by well-known manufacturers are 
fitted with the Interarms Mark X.
