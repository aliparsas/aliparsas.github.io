<p> A group of Iranian "off-roaders" invited me to join them in an attempt to go to the
 center of Rig-e Jenn. They had two previous experiences with such a task. In their 
<a href="http://rigejen.topcities.com">second trip</a> in 2003, they were able to cross
 the area east to west (although not through the center.)
In this trip we were not successful either. But we think we found a southern pass
 for Rig-e Jenn. The pictures in this page are all courtesy of Yousof "Nasser" Rahmani.

    <TD><BR>Once again with the rod #1 on the way to Rig-e Jenn. 
There are five of these rods planted by Mr. Miranzadeh back in 
1997 when he was the head of Kavir National Park. The rods act as road-signs in an area with virtually no landmarks. Here he is seen 
with some of the members of our expedition. </TD>

      The main vehicle in this trip was old military jeep M151. 
This car is known in Iran as "Mule", although mule is the nick name 
of another military vehicle in the US.</TD>

    <TD><BR>In Rig-e Jenn after all. We named the place Pir-e Tagh (old saxaul) 
because of this unusually large saxaul (Haloxylon). Here we ended this trip's effort to 
penetrate Rig-e Jenn. We'll try to go in next time from the same area. 
This location seems to be a southern gate to Rig-e Jenn.</TD>

    <TD><BR>Once again in the beautiful village of Ashin. My friend Mohammad-Reza 
Sarebani was there by chance. Here we have just finished a post-trip navigation 
with him. Hamid Boreiri, the leader of the off-road group is seen in front.</TD>
