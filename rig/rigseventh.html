<p>In this trip we made it to the <a href="7points.jpg">center of Rig-e Jenn</a>. This is an
 important step toward
 the future crossing of this remote and never-before-travelled area.
<p> In the <a href="http://www.aliparsa.com/rig/rigsixth.html">sixth trip</a> we
 figured that to avoid salt marshes and mud plains we should enter Rig-e Jenn from
 southwest. We did this in this trip and we were successful. Except for a broken engine near
 where we camped (point 7camp in the <a href="http://www.aliparsa.com/rig/7points.jpg">image</a>),
 we did not encounter any problems on our way.
<p> Surely weather played a decisive role in our success. Recent rains made the sandhills firm
 and passable.
 The good weather after the rains dried the flats. And we had gourgeuos weather while there:
 no sand storms or gusty winds.

<p> We used a laptop computer
 (courtesey of Mr. Mostafa Azizi) and GPS device to navigate. I downloaded a good
 satellite image of the area from NASA's <a href="https://zulu.ssc.nasa.gov/mrsid/mrsid.pl">Mr. Sid</a> site. We located promissing low hills
 on the image and used the GPS to go to those passes.
<p> What made us to go back and not
 try to cross Rig-e Jenn was that our image did not show a suitable pass in a long sandy
 ridge which we named the Great Wall of China. We'll try this in our future trips.
<p> After getting to the center, we explored the southern part of Rig-e Jenn. It is a
 very interesting area with varied vegetation and signs of wildlife. We went to
 Ashin where a support group from Tehran joined us. They brought another MUTT
 engine and we replaced the broken engine with the new one. The trip ended with us
 exploring for a shorter route to reach Rig-e Jenn from southwest.
<p> Members of this
 trip were: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hamidboreiri">Hamid Boreiri</a>, Mohammad-Bagher
 Nosratloo, Ebrahim Ameri, Jalal PourEbrahim, Soheil Nosrat and Ali Parsa. The support team members,
 who joined us later, were Reza Ebrahimian, Davoud "Colonel" Najafzadeh and Davoud Fathali.
