<p>After reaching the center, we had to wait for the support car to bring us
 a replacement engine for our broken car. We used this time to explore the area
 south of Rig-e Jenn and finding a way from Rig-e Jenn to the deserted village
 of Baba Khaled and Ashin.
 
<p> Here are some photos of this second phase of our trip:

    <TD><BR><p>If you look at the satellite image of Rig-e Jenn, you'll clearly distinguish two
 different terrains there.
 One in the north is the typical area with long sand dunes and vast salty plains. The other to the
 south (what I call the tail of Rig-e Jenn) is full of low sandy hills and much vegetation. We
 saw many tracks of animals in this area. I saw a sand fox (<i>Vulpes rueppellii</i>), tracks
 of hares and sand cats (<i>Felis margarita</i>) and many rodents. </TD>

    <TD><BR> The strangest thing we saw in this trip: a wolf track in the middle of Rig-e Jenn.
 The area was near the point 718 in the <a href="http://www.aliparsa.com/rig/7points.jpg">image</a>.
 We never expected to see a mamal track in this
 place which has no water in a radius of almost 60 kilometers.</TD>

    <TD><BR>Baba Khaled. Like Ashin, this is now a deserted place. Will this small oasis be
 revived someday?</TD>
</TR>

  <TR>
    <TD><BR> Mainstreet Ashin. In the back the old stone citadel which used to protect caravans from desert
 thives. The small mud houses belong to people from Anarak, who come to this place once in
 a while to spend their holidays or poach the game in the area. </TD>
