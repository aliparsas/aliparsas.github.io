In Hormozgan we visited the village of Kukherd, made famous by my unseen friend Mr. Mohammayan through his numerous articles in the <a href="http://fa.wikipedia.org/">Persian Wikipedia</a>. He is from Kukherd and lives in the UAE. When asked by Ramin Kotobi for an idea for a Norouz trip, I instantly said we should go to Kukherd because I have read his articles about the area in Wikipedia, and I was curious to visit there. There were seven of us with two SUVs.  Mr. Mohammadyan was kind enough to introduce us to his many friends in Kukherd and we were in good hands there. Here are some pictures, taken by a cheap, old camera, legacy of the schoolgirl days of my two daughters.<br><TABLE  cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" width="100%" bgColor=#ffffcc border=0><TR><TD><P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>       Ardeshir's Palace</FONT></FONT><br><p><FONT size=2>   On our way to Hormozgan, we spent the first night by the magnificent palace of Ardeshir Babakan, the founder of the Sassanid empire, near the city of Firouzabad. </FONT></FONT></TD><TD><p align=center><IMG src="ardeshir.jpg" alt="Palace of Ardeshir" border=0 ></TD></TR><TR><TD><p align=center><IMG src="squinch.jpg" alt="squinch" border=0 ></TD><TD>      <P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>       Squinch</FONT></FONT><br><BR><FONT size=2> A squinch in Ardeshir's palace, holding one of the three domes of the building.
