<br><BR>Bastak is in the south of the city of Lar.  For many years people from  
these parts of Iran have immigrated to southern parts of the Persian gulf in search of better jobs and  
prosperity. Many have been successful, becoming citizens in the UAE and other countries there. But,  
many have kept their connection to their native land and have contributed to the development of the  
south Iran region. Mosques and water reservoirs are main public facilities that has been built or  
renovated by  the donations from such Iranian expatriates. This is the new Jame mosque of Bastak,  
built by donated money from abroad. (Picture courtesy of Mr. Mohammadyan)

<br><P>Gav Guchi,  was the traditional water wheel used in Kukherd in the old times.  
A bull (Gav, in Persian) was used to  draw water from wells to the surface. The bull pulled a rope at  
the end of which there was a bucket in the well. The bull moved down a sloped plane (Guchi, in local  
dialect) to facilitate its movement. This remarkable full size replica was built by the town council of  
Kukherd. At right is the dome of a Berkeh.)

<p>Berkeh, or traditional water reservoir, is used to gather rain water for consumption. Despite its  
simple looking appearance, many technical considerations are envisioned to ensure quality of the  
water inside. The many openings around the dome ensures air circulation which help the water to  
preserve its freshness. Here Ali Parsa is standing in one of the openings of a Berkeh, facing the water  
inside

      <P> <br>Posing for a picture with Kukherd friends at Mr. Alirezaii's place. We were kindly received although we didn't know any of them before. Apart from the well-known Iranian hospitality, being a friend of Mr. Mohammadyan helped a lot.

<P>Ali Parsa with Mr. Alirezaii, our host in Kukherd. He and his family were generous in catering for us in Kukherd. He gathered many of Mr. Mohammadyan's friends at his place so that we could talk to them and learn more about Kukherd and its history and traditional way of life. He is also the webmaster of the <a href="http://www.kookherd.net/">Kukherd site</a>.

      <P> <br>Sharzad's hand decorated in the local tradition with Henna. This is usually done to a bride on her wedding day. Shahrzad was invited to a wedding ceremony in Kukher and she was offered to have her hand painted by a very talented Kukherdi lady.

<P>Reza Haeri and Houshyar Dehdashtian near Tareneh, an old under water aquaduct. This aquaduct was built to take fresh water of the nearby mountains accros the salty Mehran river. The river and the water in Tareneh do not mix, thanks to the water-tight walls of the aquaduct. Some say this technique dated back from Sassani time.</a>.
