In this trip I visited Italy and Czech Republic for the first time. Train was our main means of travel, and we insisted on local traditional food, whenever possible. In all we visited many cities, including Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels (in passing), Amsterdam, The Hague, Leiden, Copenhagen, Malmo, Stockholm, Berlin, Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Munich, Salzburg, Boltzano, Florence, Rome, Genoa, Nice and Biarritz. These cities are in ten countries, namely France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria and Italy. The trip took about a month, so given the number of cities visited it can be considered a quick tour of Europe.</center><p><TABLE cellSpacing=1 cellPadding=4 width="90%" align=center bgColor=#ffffcc border=0>  <TBODY><TR>	<TD>      <P>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT size=+2><FONT color=#cc0000>Paris</FONT></FONT>      <p>Shahrzad the back-packer on a bridge over the Seine near the Eifel Tower.	</TD>	<TD><p align=center><IMG src="eifel.jpg" alt="Shahrzad with the Eifle Tower" border=0 >  </TD></TR><TR>	<TD><p align=center><IMG src="kaveh.jpg" alt="With Kaveh Moghaddari in Paris" border=0 ></TD>	<TD><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Kaveh is an old friend found anew after some 26 years.

So the building has some significance for me too.</td></tr><tr><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica">A surprise find in Leiden: We saw this model boum, a kind of Persian Gulf dhow, behind a window of a house in Leiden.

We traveled from Amsterdam to Malmo, and then we took a night train to Stockholm. The city has its peculiar architecture. One aspect of Stockholm is that it is built on a very rocky terrain. No wonder Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. They need it, instead of picks and showels to level the ground and build houses. 	</TD>	<TD><p align=center><IMG src="stockholmnight.jpg" alt="Stochholm skyline at night" border=0 >  </TD></TR><tr><td> <img src="runestone.jpg"></td><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica">A runestone used as a cornerstone of an old building in Sockholm's old town district.

This is not a majestic church at all, but thinking that Bach himself used to play and conduct music here goes beyond the humble appearance.<p>The organist that evening was Ulrich Böhme, who in a sense is Bach's successor. He played pieces by Messian, Dupre and  Mendelssohn, but the height of the evening for me was when he started Bach's 'Dorian' Toccata (BWV 538).
