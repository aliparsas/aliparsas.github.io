Here are some questions you may ask, with answers:</FONT></FONT></FONT> <P><B><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>Why a Motorcycle?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=2>Apart from the pure fun of it, I have decided that a trail motorcycle is the most efficient means of transportation for my exploration work in <A href="http://www.aliparsa.com/rig.html">Rig-e Jenn</A>. I have tried 4x4s and camels before (not to mention airplanes). Motorcycle gives you the mobility you need in this unexplored environment and saves you precious time. Yes, it is not that environment friendly (will leave tire traces along the way, and the noise is ugly compared to the enchanting sound of the kavir breeze), but then, this will be a one time venture.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <P><B><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>Why Bultaco?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=2>I started looking for a bike, till I met Mr. Kaboli. He was once a <A href="http://www.aliparsa.com/personal/friends/kaboli.html">representative of Bultaco</A> in Iran. He suggested that we use his old Alpina 350, "because it is the best trail bike ever built." This was an offer I couldn't refuse, especially since there was no charge!</FONT></FONT></FONT> <TABLE width="100%" border=0>  <TBODY>  <TR>    <TD>      <P><B><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>Why       Restoration?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT face=arial><FONT       color=#000099><FONT size=+1></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=arial       color=#000099 size=2>Mr. Kaboli's Alpina was abandoned for more than 18       years. It was sitting in his backyard at the mercy of the elements. Surely       the bike needed more than a "light service". The piston and the cylinder,       for one, were completely worn out due to overheating. I consulted several       Bultaco sites on the Internet for guidance and was drawn to this       restoration job as a result.       <P>I had the cylinder re-bored, and two piston rings custom-made because       we didn't have original Bultaco rings here. Body and cylinder and cylinder       head where powder-coated. Gasckets were replaced with original ones from       Bultaco. Rear lights were replaced, also with originals. The handle bar and some       other chrome pieces were chrome-plated. The seat was almost totally rebuilt.      <p>The only part I didn't mess with was the gear-box. I didn't have the time, nor the confidence,       to tackle with it.</FONT></P></TD>    <TD><IMG height=189 src="pistonold.jpg"       width=183></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=+1></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=+1></FONT></FONT></FONT><B><FONT face=arial color=#cc0000 size=+1>Did I ride it?</FONT></B> <BR><FONT color=#000099><FONT face=arial size=4><FONT size=2>In October 2000 I rode it from Tehran to the city of Tonkabon in north of Iran, and back: a roundtrip of 400+ km. Apart from an unusual appetite for gas, it posed no problems. I changed the original carburetor with a Japanese one which reduced the consumption to almost half. <P><B><FONT face=arial color=#cc0000 size=+1>Where is it now?</FONT></B> <BR>In Dec. 2000 I left the bike in Tehran, when I moved to the USA. Mr. Kaboli took it back, and as far as I know, it is back where it was before the restoration, waiting for a ride.</FONT> <P><B><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>And the pictures?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT face=arial color=#000099 size=2>Here are some <A href="http://www.aliparsa.com/bultaco/bultaco2.html">Pictures</A> of the restoration.</FONT><FONT face=arial>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> <P><B><FONT face=arial color=#cc0000 size=+1>Who helped me?</FONT></B> <BR><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=2>My friend <A href="http://www.aliparsa.com/personal/friends/behrouz.html">Behrouz Ziaii</A> has helped me with this restoration.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=arial color=#000099 size=2><A href="http://www.aliparsa.com/personal/friends/zarrin.html">Mr. Zarrin</A> did the powder coating of the frame, the cylinder, and the cylinder head, free of charge. <BR><A href="http://www.aliparsa.com/personal/friends/reza.html">Reza Najafi-Manesh</A> had the handle bar plated and exhaust pipe powder-coated in <A href="http://www.fanarlool.com/">Fanar Lool</A>, a factory that he manges. <BR>Brothers Mehdi and Arash Delshad helped with the electrical wiring. </FONT><P><IMG src="tim.jpg" width="51" height="57"><FONT face=arial><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=2> Tim Weaver from <A href="http://www.bultaco.com/">Hugh's Bultaco </A>has also helped me with technical tips via email.
