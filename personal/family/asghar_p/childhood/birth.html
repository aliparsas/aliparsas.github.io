Asghar Parsa was born at a time when there were no official
identification requirements for the Iranians. His identification
booklet was issued in 1926. Although the original booklet is lost, an
official transcript issued in 1942 states his date of birth as 1915.
But on many occasions he has stated that this date is wrong and the
real year of birth is 1919.
