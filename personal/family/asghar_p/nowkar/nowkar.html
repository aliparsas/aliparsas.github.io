After their release from the shah's prisons, some of the supporters of
Dr. Mossadiq, who resigned, were fired, or simply did not want to work
in their previous government positions, decided to form a company to be
able to earn a living in the new situation. The Nowkar company was
established in 1955, with Mr. Ahmad Zanganeh, one of Dr. Mossadiq's
ministers, as its President. Among others in the Board were Mr.
Seifollah Moazami (former Minister of PTT in Mossadiq's cabinet), Mr.
Ali Asghar Bashir-Farahmand (a former Director of Radio). Asghar Parsa
was a member of the Board.<p align="center"> <img src="apnowkar.jpg">
