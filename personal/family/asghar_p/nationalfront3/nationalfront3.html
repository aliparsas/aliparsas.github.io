and after the 1979 revolution in Iran, National Front started to act
again. Asghar parsa was one of the main figures of this new period.

of the Publisher of the main National Front monthly newspaper.

after this picture, the National Front club was raided by
fundamentalist elements and NF leaders were forced to go into hiding.
Asghar Parsa lived for more than a year in hiding, before he was
arrested in 1983.
