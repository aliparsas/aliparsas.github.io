<font color="#000080" face="Century Gothic" size="6"><font size="2">At
the hight of the oil dispute between Iran and Britain, the US
government tried to mediate. Hossein Makki, the outspoken pro-Mossadiq
parliament member was invited to the US for a tour of American oil
industry facilities, and informal talks. Given Makki's personal
political ambitions, pro-mossadiq faction in Majlis decided to send
Asghar Parsa with Makki to the US to provide Americans with geniune
pro-Mossadiq views.
On their way to the US, Makki and Parsa went to Germany and had an
unscheduled meeting with Dr. Hossein Fatemi, Mossadiq's Foreign
Minister, who was in that country for medical treatment of the wounds
he suffered as result of an assasination effort by the muslim
extrimists.
