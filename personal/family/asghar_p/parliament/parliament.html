<p><font color="#000080" face="Century Gothic" size="6"><font size="2">The
year 1950 marks the begining of the Oil Nationalization Movement in
Iran. Dr. Mohammad Mossadiq was elected by Majlis (the Iranian
Parliament) in 1951 to serve as the Prime Minister, and his main
program was resolving the issue of oil. National sentiments ran high in
the country and people were drawn to the politics.
Asghar Parsa decided that it was time to participate in this national
movement. He resigned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ran for
the parliament. He was elected from his hometown of Khoy, in what was
considered the most free elections in Iran up to then.
Despite his young age, he was soon elected to be the spokesman of the
National Movement, a pro-Mossadiq minority faction in the Majlis.
