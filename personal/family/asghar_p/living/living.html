<font color="#000080" face="Century Gothic" size="6"><font size="2">In
the mid-60's, after the shah's "White Revolution", political activities
were in recession, due to intense SAVAK pressure. Asghar Parsa took the
advantage to do something for his, and his family's, financial well
being. He opted for going to supervise Nowkar projects in remote parts
of the country. The pay was much higher in those projects.</font></font><p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Century Gothic" size="6"><font size="2"> <img src="apeskolak.jpg">

major endeavor of the Nowkar Co. was the Tarik Dam project, done
jointly with the company WRD. Here is a picture of those years. Left to
right: Mr. Solh-Konan, Mr. Fatemi, Asghar Parsa, Mr. Cohen, Ms. Zabet.
The picture is taken in front of the offices of the project near the
mountain village of Eskolak, in the province of Gilan. The date is
circa 1965.
