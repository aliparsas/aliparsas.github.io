<P align=center>Patti is the originator of the Kidlink program. I found about her work in 1994 and we have been in touch, on and off, since then. Her <a href="http://www.globalclassroom.org/">Global Classroom site</a> has more info about her extensive activities. My two daughters used the Kidlink program to communicate with other kids around the world.  Here are <a href="http://www.globalclassroom.org/saba.html">Saba's messages</a>  exchanged with some of her friends in the Kidlink back then.
