<CENTER><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000>Ramin is my uncle (my late 
mother's brother). He is three years my younger. An accomplished MD, specialized 
in internal medicine, he teaches in university, works in hospitals, and has 
published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. At the same time 
he is a top ranking calligrapher, and a very good painter. While we were kids, 
he led me into model aircrafts, astronomy and photography.</FONT></CENTER>

<P align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000>All these are fit 
subjects for a complete Web site. But here I want to highlight another of his 
extraordinary talents: Hot Roding! During the past few years he has undertaken a 
task of restoring and beefing up of a V8 engine. The project is finished now and 
here you see some of the pictures of this endeavor.</FONT></P>

<P align=center>And this is what they delivered: a 400 bhp V8 ready to be 
installed in a Camaro that Ramin has just bought for the purpose.</P>
