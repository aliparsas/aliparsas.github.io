<P>He was a mechanical 
engineering student at Aryamehr University. He also organized a Music Room there 
for students to enjoy classical music. This earned him the nick-name 
"Abolmusighi" which literaly means 'Father of Music' in Arabic. 
<BR>He resides in Sweden 
and is workiong as a mechanical design engineer in a Swedish rotor development 
firm. This makes him one of the few AMUT graduates who are practicing what they 
studied in the college.
