<P>Reza, sometimes known as "Adopted Son", is one big catch I made in my desert trips. I met him in the old carvanseray of Maranjab in 2004, and we have been great friends since. 

He is an accomplished documentary film maker. His latest film <i>Final Fit</i> has won awards and got good reviews in Iran and abroad, including one in the Daily Star.
