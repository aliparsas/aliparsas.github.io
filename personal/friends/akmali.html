<P>Azita Akmali is a family friend. We re-discovered her as the the softspoken and very intelligent member of the French Embassy in Tehran. 

I have been fortunate to work with her in several science related projects for the Zirakzadeh Science Foundation.

She lives in Tehran with her husband and two nice kids, Mercedes and Amir Ali.
