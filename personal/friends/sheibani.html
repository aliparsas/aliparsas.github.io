<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">I met Mohammad Sheibani in a desert near Khoor 
and, in central Iran, while trying to find the way to the small village of Mesr. 
He was generous enough to park his motorcycle in the middle of nowhere and 
accompany us to the village. Since then we have been friends. He is an 
elementary school teacher and also operates a meat shop in Khoor. His passion is 
hunting with his Brno rifle. His request for me to bring him a rifle scope from 
the US resulted in my investigations about <A 
href="http://www.geocities.com/aliparsa/brno.html">Brno history</A> and 
technical aspects. Of course, he didn't get a scope from me, as I don't approve 
of hunting the few remaining games in the region. He got a Leupold scope from 
other sources.</FONT>
