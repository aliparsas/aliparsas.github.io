<P>I met Bill Miller in Tehran, when I was looking for international scientists 
to invite to Iran for the occasion of the 1999 total solar eclipse. He was with 
<A href="http://www.sfcg.org/">Search for Common Ground</A> then and kindly 
helped us to come in contact with Dr. Alan Hale and the rest of the group. 
<P>He is very interested in Iran and has been to Iran many times.
