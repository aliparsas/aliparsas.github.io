The aim of the tour was to visit       some of the areas in which existence of <A       href="http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/agarman/cheetah.htm">Asiatic Cheetah       (<I>Asinonyx jubatus venaticus</I>)</A> is reported. Asiatic Cheetah, or       Yuz, as it is called in Persian, exists only in Iran and is on the brink       of extinction. Some reports say that only less than 50 may still exist in       Yazd and Khorasan provinces of Iran.       <P>In this trip we visited areas around <A       href="http://www.geocities.com/ms_anaraki/index.html">Anarak</A>, like       Ashin and Balazoon areas, and also Kalmand and Bahadoran protected areas       near Yazd. But the most promising areas were Darreh Anjir and Hassan Beygi       north of Bafq. In these two areas we spotted tracks of cheetah.     </P></FONT></TD>    <TD><BR>      <CENTER><IMG height=152 src="yuz4.jpg"       width=150 align=center></CENTER><FONT size=2>This picture is       taken by Bijan Dareh-shouri, an expert Iranian environmentalist and       photographer.
