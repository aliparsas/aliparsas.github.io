This was my first visit to that country. Despite the usual worries about the security, we enjoyed the hospitality of the people in the city. Here are some pictures of that short trip, all taken by my friend and fellow-traveller Farshad Sajjadi.</center><p><TABLE cellSpacing=1 cellPadding=4 width="90%" align=center bgColor=#ffffcc border=0>  <TBODY><TR>    <TD><FONT size=2><FONT color=#cc0000><FONT size=+1>The City</FONT></FONT>      <br><BR><FONT size=2>City of Herat, as seen from the top of its historic citadel.
