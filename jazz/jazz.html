am
not sure when my interest in jazz music started, but I am sure it was
early in my life and it started with cinema.<br>
      <br>
My mother used to take me to cinema as soon
as I was able to walk. She loved to see new movies and I was her
passport to avoid unwanted attention in a male dominated society of the
time. The music in these movies where different kinds of jazz, mostly
big band.
This was before rock n' roll started to be known in Iran. I remember
the films like <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> (1953) with the song <i>Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend</i>. I looked with fascination to the
trombone players on the big screen.</font><br>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><font color="#660000" face="Arial, Helvetica">Before
the film was started, they usually played contemporary hits of the
time, which were usually Latin American music; pieces by Perez Prado
and the like. The orchestration and the color of the music was engraved
in my heart. <br>

I saw <i>The Glenn Miller Story</i>,
a 1954 film. I think it was a 1957 or 1958 re-screening of the film in
Tehran. I vaguely remember my mother telling me about the kind of music
that was played in the movie, and I think that was when I&nbsp; first
heard
the word <i>jazz</i>. I vividly remember the&nbsp; scene when their
plane
was crashing&nbsp; and&nbsp; Glenn (James Stewart)&nbsp; and the band
played on, and
the camera tilted to show the crashing plane is diving to its sad fate.

that film I saw a mock-trombone in a toy shop and my parents bought it

there was this Natalie Wood film <i>All the Fine Young Cannibals</i>
(1960) with the story about a
trumpet player (loosely based on Chet Baker) played by Robert Wagner.
There was a
jazz funeral scene in the film, and I remember the amused reaction of
the crowd in the cinema to the song's change of tempo and mood from
somber to jubilant. I remember I enjoyed the music in the film,
and when we were home I tried to play similar style music on my toy
trombone. That didn't work and I was content playing songs in the vain
of Summertime with my lips, imitating a trumpet.</font></font><br>

<div align="left"><font color="#660000"><font face="Arial, Helvetica">A
jazz club scene in one 1960s 'mondo' film, the name of which I don't
remember, was also an influence on me. In the scene a jazz combo
(trio?) was playing in a NY club. The relaxed young audience were
listening in enjoyment while some were holding their drinks in their
hands. The mellow mood of the music and of the audience added to my
perception of what a jazz performance and its fans look like.<br>

appeared much earlier, in the 1930s. But the first jazz programme was
aired
in Iran in the early 1960s. Fereydoon Farhat had a weekly radio show
called <i>Jazz, the Music of Blacks</i>. He selected nice mainstream
jazz albums and briefly introduced the musicians. <br>

Philharmonic Orchestra, and also produced musical programmes for the
radio.<img alt="The young Fereydoon Naseri." src="naseri.jpg" align="right" height="136" width="149"> His weekly Jazz show was

AFRTS also operated a television channel in Tehran. The series Peter

classical, jazz and pop LPs for their customers. The sound system at
